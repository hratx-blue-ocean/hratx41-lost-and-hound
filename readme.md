##Introduction
------------

This project was a brief 1-week sprint where our team tried to complete an MVP for an external user (Louis Rangel). Louis envisioned a website that connected lost dogs and their owners. Our team attempted to create a simple, elegant environment to easily achieve this goal. 

-   Add any additional content here pertaining to timeline, any personal goals, etc

##What does the app do?
---------------------

* What problem does it solve? Who uses it?

It solves the problem of local resources for finding lost dogs and their owners being spread out across too many places.  People who find or lose dogs use it.

* Why was it built?

It was built in order to more easily facilitate reuniting a lost dog with their owner

* User Inputs and Outputs

The user inputs whether they've lost or found a dog and receives a list of dogs that have been found or lost depending on which they choose.

* 

You can also input a lost or found dog to add to our personal database and they will then show up on subsequent searches.

##Technical Challenges and research that you anticipated
------------------------------------------------------

* Why, what was the plan to overcome those challenges?

We expected getting and formatting the data to be the biggest challenge.  

* What did you learn?

##Challenges that were unexpected
-------------------------------

* Why was it a challenge

It was common for website/robots.txt files to prohibit web scraping, which initially was our plan for generating data on lost dogs. 

* What did you learn?

Sometimes you just can not legally scrape a website and there is no way around it. In some cases you may need to be granted permission, but either way it is very important to first check out a websites robots.txt page and understand their parameters. 

##Video Demo / Screen shot walkthrough of the app
-----------------------------------------------

* What were the user stories /  what was MVP (mention Minimal Viable Product)

-As a user I should be able to specify if I have lost or found a dog so that I can be directed to the appropriate search page

-As a user I should be able to select a lost/found dog's lost/found date so that I can retrieve the appropriate data matching that description

-As a user I should be able to select a lost/found dog's size so that I can retrieve the appropriate data matching that description

-As a user I should be able to select a lost/found dog's location so that I can retrieve the appropriate data matching that description

-As a user I should be able to select a lost/found dog's color so that I can retrieve the appropriate data matching that description

-As a user a should see a list of lost/found results in chronological order that matches the search criteria so that I can get the most recent and relevant data

-As a user I should be able to submit dog description data so I can forward that information to the community/internet

-As a user who has found a lost dog, I want to be able to see relevant ad information for products and resources so that I can prevent this problem in the future

-As a user, I should be able to contact the OP for a post so that I can inform them that I have found / lost this dog

-As a user I should be able to see the top 10 results of my search query and then see more when I scroll to the end, so that I can see a continuous list of dogs

-As a user, if my search query is taking longer than 1 second, I should see visual feedback of my search result so that I can know that the website is working

MVP -  

The MVP was to have an interactive search that allowed the display of lost or found dogs from other sources. Find a list of lost/found dogs based on location. Be able to sort by description/categories/most recent. Kust resources per location. Organize info by photo/description/id. Webscraper for facebook, craigslist, reddit, austin pets.

##How does the app work?
----------------------

* What happens behind the scenes when the user interacts with it? 

Once the user has sent their query the server pings

* OR What are all the place the data travels?  What happens to that data?

* Optionally include a diagram

* How does the tech stack come together?

##What research was required?
---------------------------

Appropriate Api's for finding the correct data.

Scraping and its usefulness for finding relevant data

Sorting methods

Determining area and distance

##Workflow and Key lessons from your team - specifically those related to: Agile, CI/CD, testing, working with external stakeholders, ticketing, and user stories.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Your git workflow, style guides, commit guides, etc

We had a master, develop, and personal feature branches. The master branch stores the official release history, and the develop branch serves as an integration branch for features. Develop contains a complete history of the project, where master contains an abridged version. Our developers continuously need to pull to their develop branch and then merge that with their feature branch to stay up to date and minimize conflicts. Each new feature should reside in its own branch, which can be pushed to the develop branch upon completion. Features should never interact directly with the master branch, they strictly merge with the develop branch.  

* What did you learn from the process

Using a dedicated branch to prepare releases makes it possible for one team to polish the current release while another team continues working on features for the next release. It also creates well-defined phases of development. Git workflow is great for agile development, allowing large teams to constantly develop independently and come together with ease as a whole. 

* What were key takeaways from stand ups, code reviews, etc

Testing testing testing. Always test before pull request as things can slip past.

Stand-ups are a fundamental part of agile development. The stand-up is important to keep everyone aware of the team's landscape and progress. It allows each member to share what they have been working on and what they are planning to do next. We held our meetings first thing in the morning and quickly went around the group where everyone shared and updated the group. These meetings highlight progress and help flag any larger issues. The daily reinforcement of sharing individual successes and plans keep everyone excited about the team's overall contribution to the organization.

* Writing tests

In the long run, writing tests actually make our code more robust, and easier to maintain. Tests are also important in catching bugs earlier, the more you wait the more nested and difficult the bug becomes, testing allows you to catch bugs early. Testing also improves the quality of code by identifying defects.

* Link to your trello board, discuss completed tickets

<https://trello.com/b/K6y30AZf/lost-and-hound>

##Any non-MVP tickets (optional)
------------------------------

-   Code refactorings

-   Performance Optimizations

-   Additional features

-   etc

##Notes from your Sprint Retro
----------------------------

##What additional features do you plan to add, how do you plan to implement those features?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Future refactoring?

Include use of Facebook Groups API to allow for more lost and found doggie data to be scraped from local groups.

* Additional dev ops considerations?

* UI/UX additions?
